I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Public Health and Health Sciences](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/larry-han/) at Northeastern University and an Affiliate Investigator in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html).

[My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing novel statistical and machine learning methods to leverage real-world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine. This involves designing robust, efficient, and targeted estimators for causal effects using large-scale data generated from electronic health records and clinical trial data. Active areas of research include causal inference, conformal inference, data integration, federated and transfer learning, and sensitivity analysis.

I obtained my PhD in [Biostatistics at Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), advised by [Professor Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/tianxi-cai/) and [Professor Lorenzo Trippa](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/lorenzo-trippa/). I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in [Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/about), advised by [Professor Sharon-Lise Normand](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/people/sharon-lise-normand). I received an AM in Biostatistics from Harvard, an MPhil in Healthcare Operations from the University of Cambridge, an MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University, and a BS in Public Health and Biostatistics from UNC - Chapel Hill.

I enjoy playing golf, especially in my home state of North Carolina, reading history, especially biographies, and staying up-to-date with global affairs, especially US-China relations. Feel free to reach out via email: [lar.han@northeastern.edu](lar.han@northeastern.edu). 

**[I currently have openings for postdocs, PhD students, and research assistants! Feel free to contact me if you'd like to learn more about our research.]**
