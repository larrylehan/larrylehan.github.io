I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the [Department of Public Health and Health Sciences](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/larry-han/) at Northeastern University and an Affiliate Investigator in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html). [My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing novel statistical and machine learning methods to leverage real-world data to improve decision-making, with a focus on public health and clinical medicine. This includes designing robust, efficient, and targeted estimators for learning causal effects using large-scale data generated from observational studies and randomized trials. My current areas of interest include causal inference, conformal inference, data integration, federated learning, and survival analysis.

I received my PhD in [Biostatistics at Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), where I was advised by [Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/tianxi-cai/) and [Lorenzo Trippa](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/lorenzo-trippa/). I completed a postdoc in [Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/about), mentored by [Sharon-Lise Normand](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/people/sharon-lise-normand). I hold an AM in Biostatistics from Harvard, an MPhil in Healthcare Operations from the University of Cambridge, an MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University, and a BS in Public Health and Biostatistics from UNC-Chapel Hill.  

Outside of work, I enjoy playing golf, staying up-to-date on global affairs, and cheering on the UNC Tar Heels.

**[I currently have openings for postdocs, PhD students, and research assistants! Feel free to contact me if you'd like to learn more about our research.]**
