Focuses on selecting, fitting, and evaluating the general class of generalized linear models. Emphasizes linear, logistic, Poisson, and proportional hazards regression in addition to time series analyses. Stresses proper construction of models through the evaluation of modeling assumptions and assessment of model diagnostics. Introduces concepts of confounding, effect modification, and methods for missing data. Offers students an opportunity to fit, evaluate, and appropriately communicate and visualize the results of modeling techniques using a programming language and statistical software packages, as well as practice on techniques for data cleaning on real examples of messy data.
